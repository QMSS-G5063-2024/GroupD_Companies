### Overview:

In an era marked by rapid globalization and technological advancements, understanding the dynamics of leading corporations and their impact on the global economy is increasingly critical. This project delves into the characteristics, performance, and regional distribution of the top 10,000 companies, as listed in a comprehensive dataset provided by Vedant Khapekar on Kaggle. Through the application of advanced data analytics and visualization techniques, we aim to unravel the complex interplay between corporate success and its predictors.

Our objective is to shed light on various aspects such as what companies' genre, size, location, attributes companies are highly rated for, what are critically rated for, and how different components of a company influence earnings and overall success. We have generated a series of visualizations to bring these insights to life, offering a deeper understanding of the corporate landscape.

Join us on this analytical journey as we explore these intricate dynamics. Below are the links to the datasets we utilized, which will allow you to dive deeper into our research and methodology.

### Data:

We utilized two key datasets from Kaggle for our analyses:

1. **Top 10,000 Companies Dataset** - This dataset encompasses a wide range of data points on the top 10,000 companies globally, providing a broad view of corporate success factors and challenges.

  cor(use = "complete.obs")  # Correlation on complete cases

  labs(x = '', y = '', title = 'Heatmap of Variable Correlations', subtitle = 'Correlation coefficients') +
  geom_text(aes(label = sprintf("%.2f", value)), size = 4, color = "black")
```

This heatmap provides a visual representation of the correlation coefficients between various numerical variables of a dataset. Warmer colors (reds and oranges) indicate higher positive correlations, while cooler colors (yellows) suggest weaker correlations. From the heatmap, we can see strong positive correlations between 'Avg_salary' and 'Total_benefits', and 'Interviews_taken' and 'Total_reviews'. Conversely, 'Total_jobs_available' appears to have a weaker positive correlation with the other variables. The diagonal, naturally, shows a perfect correlation of 1.0, as it represents the correlation of each variable with itself. This heatmap is a useful tool for quickly identifying relationships and potential areas for deeper analysis.

### Graph 1: Dispersal of Company Benefits Across Industry Sectors

```{r jitter plot,message=FALSE,echo=FALSE,warning=FALSE }
ggplot(companies_edited, aes(x = broader_genres, y = Total_benefits, color = broader_genres)) +
  geom_jitter(alpha = 0.5, width = 0.25) +

  labs(title = "Relationship Between Broad Genre and Total Benefits", x = "Broad Genre", y = "Total Benefits") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))
```

### Graph 2: Comparative Overview of Average Benefits by Industry Sector

```{r bar chart, message=FALSE,echo=FALSE,warning=FALSE }
companies_edited %>%
  group_by(broader_genres) %>%
  summarize(Avg_Total_Benefits = mean(Total_benefits, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = broader_genres, y = Avg_Total_Benefits, fill = broader_genres)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(title = "Average Total Benefits by Broad Genre", x = "Broad Genre", y = "Average Total Benefits") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))
```

The visualizations represent an analysis of total benefits distributed across various broad industry genres. The first, a jitterplot, displays a spread of individual company data within each genre, showing the variability and range of benefits across companies. It is particularly useful for observing outliers and the distribution within each sector. The second, a bar graph, aggregates this data to present the average total benefits per genre, providing a clear comparison of the central tendency of benefits among the different sectors.

Despite the difference in the type of visualization, both aim to elucidate how benefits vary across industries, with the jitterplot providing a more granular look while the bar graph offers a summarized view.

```

The scatterplot displays data points for the top 30 highly-rated companies among the dataset of 10,000 companies. Each point represents a company, with the position along the X-axis indicating the number of interviews conducted and the Y-axis showing the average salary offered by that company. The color gradient represents the companies' overall rating, which suggests a trend where companies with higher ratings may offer higher salaries or have a higher number of interviews. However, this trend isn't strongly evident in the plot, suggesting that the relationship between these variables may be complex or influenced by additional factors.

This network visualization illustrates the interconnected aspects that contribute to a company's holistic analysis. Central to the diagram is the "Company," with surrounding nodes representing key factors such as 'Culture,' 'Innovation,' 'Benefits,' and 'Leadership,' among others. Arrows suggest influence or flow between the company and these factors. For example, 'Financial Performance' might impact 'Sustainability,' and 'Culture' might contribute to 'Employee Satisfaction.' This visualization effectively communicates the multifaceted nature of corporate evaluation and the interdependent relationships between various attributes of a successful company.

The first visualization, a bar chart, categorizes the top 50 US tech companies by their respective sectors, displaying the number of companies within each. Sectors such as 'Software Application' and 'Semiconductors' appear to have the highest representation among these leading tech companies, indicating a robust presence in the market.

The second graph, a scatter plot, maps out these top 50 tech companies by their market capitalization and annual revenue, distinguished by sector. It illustrates that while some companies have high annual revenues, this doesn't always correspond to equally high market capitalization, suggesting varying market perceptions and potential growth expectations.

Both graphs utilize the same dataset but offer different insights: one presents the distribution of companies across sectors, while the other compares financial metrics to highlight economic size and performance within the tech industry.
